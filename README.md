## ABOUT ME 🕹️🎮👾
I was thrown into the gaming ring early, but this one came with real punches - I started MMA at 6 and went on to become a Silver National & Regional Champion in Muay Thai & Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2019. Now, I'm taking the discipline and determination from the ring to the realm of code as a CS & Engineering student at UPV, Valencia. Currently battling bugs and getting ready to embark on competitive programming in C++. I believe in the power of technology to make a difference and am excited to create tools to support underprivileged communities.
## CURRENT MISSION 🚀
Right now, I'm eagerly looking to Always $trive And Prosper on competitive programming, mathematics, and value-driven initiatives. When I'm not coding, I'm organizing and directing competitions, workshops, and other events at the faculty of computer science. I'm always on the lookout for a player two to collaborate on these quests!
## GAME OVER ⚠️
Respawn in 3... 2... 1... Back to coding!
