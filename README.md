## ABOUT ME 🕹️🎮👾
I was thrown into the ring early, starting MMA fighting at 6. Now, I'm taking the discipline and determination from the octagon to the realm of code as a CS & Engineering student at UPV, Valencia. I believe in the power of technology to make a difference and create tools to support underprivileged communities.
## CURRENT MISSION 🚀
I stay looking to Always $trive And Prosper on competitive programming, mathematics, and value-driven initiatives. When I'm not coding, I'm organizing and directing competitions, workshops, and other events at the faculty of computer science. I'm always on the lookout for a player two to collaborate on these quests!
## GAME OVER ⚠️
Respawn in 3... 2... 1... Back to coding!
