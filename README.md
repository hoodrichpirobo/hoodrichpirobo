## ABOUT ME 🕹️🎮👾

Born in Colombia and raised in Spain, I was thrown into the gaming ring early, but this one came with real punches - I started Mixed Martial Arts at 6 and went on to become a Silver National & Regional Champion in Muay Thai & Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Now, I'm taking the discipline and determination from the ring to the realm of code as a Computer Science & Engineering student at UPV, Valencia.

I'm battling bugs in Java and getting ready to embark on competitive programming in C++. My current passion project is developing a webpage to support the LGBTQIA+ community. I believe in the power of technology to make a difference and am excited to create tools to support underprivileged communities.

## CURRENT MISSION 🚀

Right now, I'm eagerly looking to always strive and prosper on competitive programming, mathematics, and value-driven initiatives. Need help getting ambitious projects done? I'm your player two! 

When I'm not coding, I'm sharing my knowledge and skills, organizing competitions, workshops, and other events at the faculty of computer science. I'm always on the lookout for fellow adventurers to collaborate on these quests!

## CONNECT WITH ME 🌐

You can reach me on LinkedIn (links in my profile sidebar) and track my progress on HackerRank and Kaggle. 

## GAME OVER ⚠️

Respawn in 3... 2... 1... Back to coding!
